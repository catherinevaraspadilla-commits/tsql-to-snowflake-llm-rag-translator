You can also use a comma to specify an inner join. If you use INNER JOIN without the ON clause, or if you use a comma without a WHERE clause, the result is the same as using CROSS JOIN: a Cartesian product; every row of o1 paired with every row of o2.\n\no1 LEFT OUTER JOIN o2  \nThe result of the inner join is augmented with a row for each row of o1 that has no matches in o2. The result columns referencing o2 contain NULL.\n\no1 RIGHT OUTER JOIN o2  \nThe result of the inner join is augmented with a row for each row of o2 that has no matches in o1. The result columns referencing o1 contain NULL.\n\no1 FULL OUTER JOIN o2  \nReturns all joined rows, plus one row for each unmatched left side row (extended with NULLs on the right), plus one row for each unmatched right side row (extended with NULLs on the left).\n\no1 CROSS JOIN o2  \nFor every possible combination of rows from o1 and o2 (that is, a Cartesian product), the joined table contains a row consisting of all columns in o1 followed by all columns in o2. A CROSS JOIN can’t be combined with an ON condition clause. However, you can use a WHERE clause to filter the results.\n\no1 NATURAL JOIN o2  \nA NATURAL JOIN is identical to an explicit JOIN on the common columns of the two tables, except that the common columns are included only once in the output. A natural join assumes that columns with the same name (but in different tables) contain corresponding data. A NATURAL JOIN can be combined with an OUTER JOIN. A NATURAL JOIN can’t be combined with an ON condition clause because the JOIN condition is already implied. However, you can use a WHERE clause to filter the results.", "approx_tokens": 449}
